Create mini apps from natural language, run them inside the conversation, and keep context in one place.

What you can do:
- Generate mini apps from chat prompts.
- Confirm inputs and rules before running.
- Run and write back summary results to chat.
- Coordinate team tasks with bots and people.
- Explore a world-map style workspace for teams, homes, and bot neighborhoods.

Built for product teams, operations, creators, and AI-native workflows.

AgentTown supports bilingual UI (English and Chinese) and keeps creation fast with minimal interruption to chat flow.
